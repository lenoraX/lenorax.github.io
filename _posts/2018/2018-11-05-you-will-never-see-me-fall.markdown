You may see me struggle,<br/>
but you won't see me fall.<br/>
Regardless if I'm weak or not,<br/>
I'm going to stand tall.<br/>
Everyone says life is easy,<br/>
but truly living it is not.<br/>
Times get hard,<br/>
people struggle<br/>
and constantly get put on the spot.<br/>
I'm going to wear the biggest smile,<br/>
even though I want to cry.<br/>
I'm going to fight to live,<br/>
even though I'm destined to die.<br/>
And even though it's hard<br/>
and I may struggle through it all,<br/>
you may see me struggle...<br/>
but you will NEVER see me fall.<br/>
